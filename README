This dirty mod is to create Korg nanoKontrol 2 extension on Linux.

The mod is copied and modified MCU source + modified (in place) csurf_main.cpp/csurf.h + Makefile.
Alls that is in reaper-plugins/reaper_csurf subdirectory.

Copy compiled binary (works on Ubuntu 18.04) or compile your own.

Build instruction:
1. follow Justin's advice to get WDL (in the top directory, see original instructions at the end)
2. cd reaper-plugins/reaper_csurf
3. make

NOTE: older REAPER has older libSWELL, can be incompatible with current one. In such case recompile libSWELL in WDL/swell (also just "make")
and copy to your REAPER location.


------------------------------------------------

This is the REAPER C/C++ extension plug-in mini-SDK

Paths:

sdk/             -- contains headers to use
reaper-plugins/  -- contains source to some plug-ins which are included with REAPER
                    (these are not to be used as models for well-designed plug-ins, 
                    but they may be useful and/or available for LGPL compliance ;)

Paths that should be added in order to compile:

WDL/

To compile most of this, merge or symlink in WDL:

git remote add wdl https://github.com/justinfrankel/WDL.git
git fetch --all
git merge --allow-unrelated-histories wdl/main
